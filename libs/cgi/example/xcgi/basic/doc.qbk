[section Handling CGI and FastCGI]

[import main.cpp]

[note
  The key bit of this example is making an fcgi::service and fcgi::acceptor and
  then using the acceptor to check if the program is running in FastCGI or
  CGI mode - by calling `fcgi::acceptor::is_cgi()` - then you handle it accordingly.
