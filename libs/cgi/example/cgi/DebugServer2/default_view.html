<h1>Debugging Server Example</h1>
<p>
    The server used in this example will catch exceptions thrown by your request handler, or a non-zero return value. It will print some presumably helpful info about what might have caused the problem - obviously this is just an example, which you'd 
    probably want to ammend.
</p>
<p>
    The handler in this example will throw a std::runtime_error if you pass 'badger=bait!' to the script, for example by following <a href="?badger=bait%21">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The handler in this example will also return false if you pass pass 'spam' to the script, for example by clicking <a href="?spam">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, you can simulate an error and get traceback details regardless of whether the script completed by passing 'debug=1',
    or by following <a href="?debug=1">this link</a>.
